# Text editors, commandlines,basic navigation and about file
* ##  **Text editors**
first off there are two types of text editors mainly : word editors and code editors , what we are interested in here are code editors such as notpad ++ , atom and visual studio code
the main difference between these two are essntial key features that are needed while coding such as themes, command highlighting and colors.
code editors can be free or paid depending on the features they give .


* ## **commandlines**
commandlines or terminals are a text base user interface were as the user interface most of us use now is GUI graphical user interface 
all opertaing systems have both  but the most notorious is LINUX, terminals are shells part of operating system running bash Bourne again shell.

* ## **basic navigation**
Terminals use commands in order to function like pwd (print working directory), ls (list), cd( change directory) and much more there are also two ways to view files or directories 
1. absolute path 
1. relative path

* ## **about file**
every thing in linux is a file even directories , it doesnt care about extensions because it looks through the file to detemine its type , linux is case sensitive so carful about typos
also usefl commands are file (type of file directory)  , ls-a (list directory  contents even hidden files).
