* HTML STANDS FOR Hyper Text Markup Langauage 
* HTML works as the basic structure of your website so its the skeleton that supports it


### **how to code using HTML**

as always when coding any language you need to start by using a propper text editor of your choice i can suggest vs code .

then you need to use some tags lets list a few 

code | function 
-----|  --------
`<!DOCTYPE html>`| THIS NOT A TAG BUT A REMINDER THAT HTML IS BEING USED HERE !
`<html>`|to intialise html
`<head>`|to add a hidden title ex: tab title
`<footer>`|to add foot notes ex; copyrights
`<p>` |to add a pargarph
`<img>`|to add an image



* there are so many tags you can you use but for the sake of example we just named a few .
* remember you need to close every tag after opening it -where as most text editors do that for you!- by typing  `</tag>`



## **Things you need to pay attention to before coding a website**
1. target an audiance in order to set goals and to know who this sites probable customers might be
1. plan a wireframe for your site by using a sketch a drawing or whatever suits you best.
1. plan a site map keep everything  organized, visible and simple to follow and youll eventually have a nice flowing with traffic website.
