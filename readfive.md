# **THE BEAUTY OF CSS**

Css stands for cascading style sheets, which means adding syle to your sheets that you are working on, as we said if html is considered the basic structre of  your web site  or the "skeleton" then Css are the skin flesh and bones .

 in other words using css you add a taste to your web site either by a background , coloring or styling the page and ordering thing around.

 
 ## how to use css

 first in order to start working on css you need to intialise it by creating a name.css file then you need to link that file in html by using `<link rel="stylesheets" href="name.css">`
 thats called external css because u code html and css on different files. 
 you can always use css internally on your .html files"internal css" and or embed its commands inside html commands "inline css" but some programmers frown upon it and call it a bad practice.
