# **A Git tutorial**

Git? you never heard of it?.

Fine, let me tell you what its about.

But first let me tell you about version control systems or VCSs.

 ## **VERSION CONTROL**
 Is basically a system for controling files and its versions either by reverting , modifying,and tracking the file edit history.
 

 ## **Types of version control:**
 
 ## 1.  local version control .
    
 the earliest type , it works locally on your hard disk to store changes on the database.

 
 
 ## 2.  centralized version control.
 
 a system accessed by mulituple clients for coding within a team a single server will be used for database.
 

 
 ## 3. Distributed version control
 in events of corruption or server failure, teams using CVCs wont be able to work on file or accesses its different versions so by creating mirrored dipositories via DVCs data back ups can be easily placed on the server. this allows for easy collaborations on the same project between teams.



 

* ##  Git dear reader is an example of DVCs



 ## **Basic concept of Git** ![gitconcept](https://www.udemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image066.png)

 
 
 
 ## SO NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU NEED TO ACCESS GIT?

 1. a terminal i can suggest Ubuntu.
 1. a text editor use Visual studio code for that .
 1. git commands to intialise your terminal.
 1. this is optional but if you want a cloud service for git Github is the place to go 

 ## And now some codes usful for you  using git
 
 
 
* first off u need to have a depository u  can create that from Github
* to import depository click clone/download from github
then use code git clone and paste your URL
* now use code . to open vs code and start coding rememeber to save your progress!
* after that use git status to check files stats
* use git add . to add changes
* git commit -m "your message here " to commit changes
* commit push origin master to push to the cloud 
* commit pull origin master to pull from the cloud

now dear reader its safe to say you can use Git! :)
